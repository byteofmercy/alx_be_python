# I want to find out how much interest I get

# I have 1000 shillings
principal = 1000

# The bank gives me 5% each year
rate = 0.05

# I leave my money for 3 years
time = 3

# Now the computer does the math
interest = principal * rate * time

# Show me the answer
print("The simple interest is:", interest)
